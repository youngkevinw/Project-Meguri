# Project-Meguri
Python project of a Google Map API implemented web application, used for travellers who wish to visit Japan and its less well known locations, but are not familiar with language.

Notes:
This is a quick project that I came up with with a friend, the database is not complete, but can be easily expanded.
Looking to expand on incorporating web scraping for more databse entries.
